============= Disk ==================
Basic Commands to check on disk usage/space

#df - report file system of disk space usage
-> shows all disk space usage 
-> you can specify a filesystem mount point/device disk usage by specifying it after df -h <>
-> (-h) human-readable format but there are many other options using df --help

#du - estimate file space usage
-> displays the total amount of disk usage a filesystem is consuming
-> you can sort it amount accordingly
-> Useful for scenarios like filesystem houskeeping
Commonly used options:
1. du -sh * | grep G // filter sizes with gigabytes 
2. du -sh * | sort -n // this sorts total file usage of each file 
3. du -hs * .[^.]* // sorting hidden files

#fdisk - manipulate disk partition table 
-> equivalent to diskpart in windows

#lsblk - list block device
->  The  command  prints all block devices (except RAM disks) in a tree-like
       format by default. 
-> no mountpoint = filesystem is not mounted
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0   8G  0 disk 
└─xvda1 202:1    0   8G  0 part /


============= Memory ==================

#free - display amount of free and used memory in the system

 total  Total installed memory (MemTotal and SwapTotal in /proc/meminfo)

       used   Used memory (calculated as total - free - buffers - cache)

       free   Unused memory (MemFree and SwapFree in /proc/meminfo)

       shared Memory used (mostly) by tmpfs (Shmem in /proc/meminfo,  available
              on kernels 2.6.32, displayed as zero if not available)

       buffers
              Memory used by kernel buffers (Buffers in /proc/meminfo)

       cache  Memory  used by the page cache and slabs (Cached and SReclaimable
              in /proc/meminfo)

       buff/cache
              Sum of buffers and cache

To display the percentage of memory utilization:
# free | grep Mem | awk '{print "Memory Usage: " $3/$2*100"%"}'

#cat /proc/meminfo
#top - displays linux processes consuming high memory usage
#vmstat - report virtual memory statictics
#sar - Collect, report, or save system activity information.
-> there are many options that you can use to create reports 


============= CPU ==================
#top
To display the percentage of CPU utilization:
#top -n 1|grep Cpu| awk '{print "CPU utilization: " $2+$4"%"}'
# sar -u //reporting cpu utilization
# ps -eo pcpu,pid,user,args | sort -k1 -r | head -10 // displays top 10 consumers of cpu
ps command displays every process (-e) with a user-defined format (-o pcpu). First field is pcpu (cpu utilization). It is sorted in reverse order to display top 10 CPU eating process.
