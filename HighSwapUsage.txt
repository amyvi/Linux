Linux has two forms of swap space: the swap partition and the swap file. The swap partition is an independent section of the hard disk used solely for swapping; no other files can reside there. The swap file is a special file in the filesystem that resides amongst your system and data files.

How to check swap total size of memory and swap?
# free -m   
> under used column

How to list all processes consuming swap space?
# grep Swap /proc/[1-9]*/smaps

Check swappiness value:
# cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness

To temporary alter it until the next reboot:
# echo 50 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness

To alter permanently:

Update swappiness:
# vi /etc/sysctl.conf
# sysctl -w vm.swappiness=5

higher values lead to more pages being swapped, and lower values lead to more applications being kept in memory, even if they are idle.
