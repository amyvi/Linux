Analysis:
•	CPU %idle is high, system’s CPU is almost idle.
•	CPU %user stays at 70 and above, system’s CPU is being utilized by the application users; there might be CPU degradation.
•	CPU %system continues to stay high around 70 and above, system’s CPU is being utilized by the server itself; there might be some OS-related processes that might cause CPU degradation.
•	CPU %iowait continues to stay high around 50 and above, the CPU is waiting for the I/O operation to complete before it returns to CPU for another processing. There might be an issue in the storage side.
