============= CPU USAGE ==============
sar -u 
> cpu usage of current time

sar -u 3 4
> cpu usage every 3 seconds for 4 times

sar -P ALL
>-P ALL is given, the sar command reports statistics for  each  individual  processor  and global statistics among all processors.

Analysis:
- %idle is high, system’s CPU is almost idle.
- %user >=70 , system’s CPU is being utilized by the application users; there might be CPU degradation.
- %system >=70 , system’s CPU is being utilized by the server itself; there might be some OS-related processes that might cause CPU degradation.
- %iowait  >= 50 , the CPU is waiting for the I/O operation to complete before it returns to CPU for another processing. There might be an issue in the storage side.

============= MEMORY USAGE ==============
>sar -r
Analaysis:
- %memused is >= 90% = normal, free or wasted memory is beeing allocated for frequent data being used
- %commit is >= 100% = system is overcommitiong memory and is memory starved. The system might often log Out of memory (OOM) killer in the /var/log/messages. Check swap statistiscs

============= SWAP USAGE ==============
>sar -S
Analysis:
- %swpused is high = swapping and memory shortage

============= DISK USAGE ==============
>sar -d -p 
Analysis:
- %util continue to stay high, this indicates that the device involved in the system has lots of I/O operation requests. Needs to be checked on storage level


============= ALERTS ==============
OS Level:
> dmesg
> /var/log/messages

VMware Servers:
> Vcenter alarms

Physical Servers:
> iLo
